# ChipExerciser_6809

The purpose of the Chip Exerciser is to test and verify the function of large scale integrated circuits, such as microprocessors, with a minimal application system implemented in software.<br>
A very simple means to verify the function is a hardware NOP generator. The device described here can provide the same functionality. Above that, it allows running arbitrary, yet small, assembler programs on the CPU.<br>
This Chip Exteriser serves as a proof-of-concept and supports the Motorola 6809 microprocessor.
Its hardware design is based on Kocalar [2019].
